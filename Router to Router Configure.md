**Scenerio:** Let's asssume I have two mikrotik router server two different VPC and I want to connect two microtik router through Public ip using IPSec. VPC- Default route Public IP 111.119.218.65 and Private ip 192.168.1.84. VPC-A routerÂ Private IP 10.0.0.4 and Public ip 166.108.231.62 

**Router 1 (Public IP: 111.119.218.65, Private IP: 192.168.1.84):**

Log into Router 1 using Winbox.

IPSec Peer Configuration:

Go to IP > IPsec > Peers.
Click on the + button to add a new peer.
Set the Address to 166.108.231.62 (Public IP of Router 2).

Proposal: set a name
Leave the rest as default, or adjust according to your requirements.
Click Apply.
Click OK.

IPSec Proposal Configuration:

Go to IP > IPsec > Proposals.
You can use the default proposal or create a new one.
Ensure the proposal is set to use esp, and configure encryption algorithms (e.g., aes-256 cbc and sha512).
Click Apply.
Click OK.

IPSec Identity Configuration:

**Verify the Configuration:**
Check the IPSec Status:
From a device in the 192.168.1.0/24 subnet, ping a device in the 10.0.0.0/24 subnet to verify connectivity.
Similarly, from a device in the 10.0.0.0/24 subnet, ping a device in the 192.168.1.0/24 subnet.
